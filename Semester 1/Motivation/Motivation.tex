\opening{\textbf{Dear Jacqueline Randall,}}

I am reaching out to you, because of the presentation about the Honours Program on the 13\textsuperscript{th} of November. During the presentation I became interested in the program, because it shows a different approach to self-actualisation than the study computer engineering of applied computer science (TI) o	ffers. With this motivation letter, I want to apply for a spot in the program. 

%In the presentation you spoke of 'Excellence and beyond' and I was particularly interested in the 'and beyond'-part and your answer to my question. 

The Honours program appeals to me, because it sounds and looks like one of the biggest challenges on intellectual, social and emotional level. Especially the multi-disciplinary aspect of the Honours-community speaks to me. I have various experiences with multi-disciplinary teams in the healthcare field and I always find it astounding how many different perspectives there can be in any given situation. That motivates me to work together in multi-disciplinary groups to reach our goals. 

Another aspect of the Honours program that motivates me, is the fact that failing is not a sign of weakness. In the presentation I got the impression that success is often build on many failures. With the Honours program I think I can turn my failures into learning experiences. 

I would like to further elaborate my motivational letter in an interview.
