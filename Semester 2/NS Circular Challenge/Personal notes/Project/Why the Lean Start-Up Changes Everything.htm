						<p>Launching a new enterprise—whether it’s a tech start-up, a 
small business, or an initiative within a large corporation—has always 
been a hit-or-miss proposition. According to the decades-old formula, 
you write a business plan, pitch it to investors, assemble a team, 
introduce a product, and start selling as hard as you can. And somewhere
 in this sequence of events, you’ll probably suffer a fatal setback. The
 odds are not with you: As new research by Harvard Business School’s 
Shikhar Ghosh shows, 75% of all start-ups fail.</p>
<p>But recently an important countervailing force has emerged, one that 
can make the process of starting a company less risky. It’s a 
methodology called the “lean start-up,” and it favors experimentation 
over elaborate planning, customer feedback over intuition, and iterative
 design over traditional “big design up front” development. Although the
 methodology is just a few years old, its concepts—such as “minimum 
viable product” and “pivoting”—have quickly taken root in the start-up 
world, and business schools have already begun adapting their curricula 
to teach them.</p>
<p>The lean start-up movement hasn’t gone totally mainstream, however, 
and we have yet to feel its full impact. In many ways it is roughly 
where the big data movement was five years ago—consisting mainly of a 
buzzword that’s not yet widely understood, whose implications companies 
are just beginning to grasp. But as its practices spread, they’re 
turning the conventional wisdom about entrepreneurship on its head. New 
ventures of all kinds are attempting to improve their chances of success
 by following its principles of failing fast and continually learning. 
And despite the methodology’s name, in the long term some of its biggest
 payoffs may be gained by the <em>large</em> companies that embrace it.</p>

<p>In this article I’ll offer a brief overview of lean start-up 
techniques and how they’ve evolved. Most important, I’ll explain how, in
 combination with other business trends, they could ignite a new 
entrepreneurial economy.</p>
<h2>The Fallacy of the Perfect Business Plan</h2>
<p>According to conventional wisdom, the first thing every founder must 
do is create a business plan—a static document that describes the size 
of an opportunity, the problem to be solved, and the solution that the 
new venture will provide. Typically it includes a five-year forecast for
 income, profits, and cash flow. A business plan is essentially a 
research exercise written in isolation at a desk before an entrepreneur 
has even begun to build a product. The assumption is that it’s possible 
to figure out most of the unknowns of a business in advance, before you 
raise money and actually execute the idea.</p>
<p>Once an entrepreneur with a convincing business plan obtains money 
from investors, he or she begins developing the product in a similarly 
insular fashion. Developers invest thousands of man-hours to get it 
ready for launch, with little if any customer input. Only after building
 and launching the product does the venture get substantial feedback 
from customers—when the sales force attempts to sell it. And too often, 
after months or even years of development, entrepreneurs learn the hard 
way that customers do not need or want most of the product’s features.</p>
<p>After decades of watching thousands of start-ups follow this standard regimen, we’ve now learned at least three things:</p>
<p>1. Business plans rarely survive first contact with customers. As the
 boxer Mike Tyson once said about his opponents’ prefight strategies: 
“Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the mouth.” 
 </p>
<p>2. No one besides venture capitalists and the late Soviet Union 
requires five-year plans to forecast complete unknowns. These plans are 
generally fiction, and dreaming them up is almost always a waste of 
time.</p>

 
 <div>
  <p>The business model canvas lets you look at all nine building blocks
 of your business on one page. Each component of the business model 
contains a series of hypotheses that you need to test.</p> 
  <div> 
   <p><img src="Why%20the%20Lean%20Start-Up%20Changes%20Everything_bestanden/R1305C_A_LG.gif" alt="" moz-reader-center="true"></p> 
  </div> 
   
 </div>

<p>3. Start-ups are not smaller versions of large companies. They do not
 unfold in accordance with master plans. The ones that ultimately 
succeed go quickly from failure to failure, all the while adapting, 
iterating on, and improving their initial ideas as they continually 
learn from customers.</p>
<p>One of the critical differences is that while existing companies <em>execute</em> a business model, start-ups <em>look</em>
 for one. This distinction is at the heart of the lean start-up 
approach. It shapes the lean definition of a start-up: a temporary 
organization designed to search for a repeatable and scalable business 
model.</p>

<p>The lean method has three key principles:</p>
<p>First, rather than engaging in months of planning and research, 
entrepreneurs accept that all they have on day one is a series of 
untested hypotheses—basically, good guesses. So instead of writing an 
intricate business plan, founders summarize their hypotheses in a 
framework called a <em>business model canvas.</em> Essentially, this is a
 diagram of how a company creates value for itself and its customers. 
(See the exhibit “Sketch Out Your Hypotheses.”)</p>
<p>Second, lean start-ups use a “get out of the building” approach called <em>customer development</em>
 to test their hypotheses. They go out and ask potential users, 
purchasers, and partners for feedback on all elements of the business 
model, including product features, pricing, distribution channels, and 
affordable customer acquisition strategies. The emphasis is on 
nimbleness and speed: New ventures rapidly assemble minimum viable 
products and immediately elicit customer feedback. Then, using 
customers’ input to revise their assumptions, they start the cycle over 
again, testing redesigned offerings and making further small adjustments
 (iterations) or more substantive ones (pivots) to ideas that aren’t 
working. (See the exhibit “Listen to Customers.”)</p>

 
 <div>
  <p>During customer development, a start-up searches for a business 
model that works. If customer feedback reveals that its business 
hypotheses are wrong, it either revises them or “pivots” to new 
hypotheses. Once a model is proven, the start-up starts executing, 
building a formal organization. Each stage of customer development is 
iterative: A start-up will probably fail several times before finding 
the right approach.</p> 
  <div> 
   <p><img src="Why%20the%20Lean%20Start-Up%20Changes%20Everything_bestanden/R1305C_B_LG.gif" alt=""></p> 
  </div> 
  <p><strong>1.</strong> Founders translate company ideas into business 
model hypotheses, test assumptions about customers’ needs, and then 
create a “minimum viable product” to try out their proposed solution on 
customers.</p> 
  <p><strong>2.</strong> Start-up continues to test all other hypotheses
 and tries to validate customers’ interest through early orders or 
product usage. If there’s no interest, the start-up can “pivot” by 
changing one or more hypotheses.</p> 
  <p><strong>3.</strong> The product is refined enough to sell. Using 
its proven hypotheses, the start-up builds demand by rapidly ramping up 
marketing and sales spending, and scales up the business.</p> 
  <p><strong>4.</strong> Business transitions from start-up mode, with a
 customer development team searching for answers, to functional 
departments executing its model.</p> 
 </div>

<p>Third, lean start-ups practice something called <em>agile development,</em>
 which originated in the software industry. Agile development works 
hand-in-hand with customer development. Unlike typical yearlong product 
development cycles that presuppose knowledge of customers’ problems and 
product needs, agile development eliminates wasted time and resources by
 developing the product iteratively and incrementally. It’s the process 
by which start-ups create the minimum viable products they test. (See 
the exhibit “Quick, Responsive Development.”)</p>
<p>When Jorge Heraud and Lee Redden started Blue River Technology, they 
were students in my class at Stanford. They had a vision of building 
robotic lawn mowers for commercial spaces. After talking to over 100 
customers in 10 weeks, they learned their initial customer target—golf 
courses—didn’t value their solution. But then they began to talk to 
farmers and found a huge demand for an automated way to kill weeds 
without chemicals. Filling it became their new product focus, and within
 10 weeks Blue River had built and tested a prototype. Nine months later
 the start-up had obtained more than $3 million in venture funding. The 
team expected to have a commercial product ready just nine months after 
that. 
 </p>

 
 <div>
  <p>In contrast to traditional product development, in which each stage
 occurs in linear order and lasts for months, agile development builds 
products in short, repeated cycles. A start-up produces a “minimum 
viable product”—containing only critical features—gathers feedback on it
 from customers, and then starts over with a revised minimum viable 
product.</p>

 </div>

<h2>Stealth Mode’s Declining Popularity</h2>
<p>Lean methods are changing the language start-ups use to describe 
their work. During the dot-com boom, start-ups often operated in 
“stealth mode” (to avoid alerting potential competitors to a market 
opportunity), exposing prototypes to customers only during highly 
orchestrated “beta” tests. The lean start-up methodology makes those 
concepts obsolete because it holds that in most industries customer 
feedback matters more than secrecy and that constant feedback yields 
better results than cadenced unveilings.</p>
<p>Those two fundamental precepts crystallized for me during my career 
as an entrepreneur. (I’ve been involved with eight high-tech start-ups, 
as either a founder or an early employee.) When I shifted into teaching,
 a decade ago, I came up with the formula for customer development 
described earlier. By 2003 I was outlining this process in a course at 
the Haas School of Business at the University of California at Berkeley.</p>
<p>In 2004, I invested in a start-up founded by Eric Ries and Will 
Harvey and, as a condition of my investment, insisted that they take my 
course. Eric quickly recognized that waterfall development, the tech 
industry’s traditional, linear product development approach, should be 
replaced by iterative agile techniques. He also saw similarities between
 this emerging set of start-up disciplines and the Toyota Production 
System, which had become known as “lean manufacturing.” Eric dubbed the 
combination of customer development and agile practices the “lean 
start-up.”</p>
<p>The tools were popularized by a series of successful books. In 2003, I wrote <span>The Four Steps to the Epiphany,</span>
 articulating for the first time that start-ups were not smaller 
versions of large companies and laying out the customer development 
process in detail. In 2010, Alexander Osterwalder and Yves Pigneur gave 
entrepreneurs the standard framework for business model canvases in <span>Business Model Generation.</span> In 2011 Eric published an overview in <span>The Lean Startup.</span> And in 2012 Bob Dorf and I summarized what we’d learned about lean techniques in a step-by-step handbook called <span>The Startup Owner’s Manual.</span></p>
<p>The lean start-up method is now being taught at more than 25 
universities and through a popular online course at Udacity.com. In 
addition, in almost every city around world, you’ll find organizations 
like Startup Weekend introducing the lean method to hundreds of 
prospective entrepreneurs at a time. At such gatherings a roomful of 
start-up teams can cycle through half a dozen potential product ideas in
 a matter of hours. Although it sounds incredible to people who haven’t 
been to one, at these events some businesses are formed on a Friday 
evening and are generating actual revenue by Sunday afternoon.</p>
<h2>Creating an Entrepreneurial, Innovation-Based Economy</h2>
<p>While some adherents claim that the lean process can make individual 
start-ups more successful, I believe that claim is too grandiose. 
Success is predicated on too many factors for one methodology to 
guarantee that any single start-up will be a winner. But on the basis of
 what I’ve seen at hundreds of start-ups, at programs that teach lean 
principles, and at established companies that practice them, I can make a
 more important claim: Using lean methods across a portfolio of 
start-ups will result in fewer failures than using traditional methods.</p>

<p>A lower start-up failure rate could have profound economic 
consequences. Today the forces of disruption, globalization, and 
regulation are buffeting the economies of every country. Established 
industries are rapidly shedding jobs, many of which will never return. 
Employment growth in the 21st century will have to come from new 
ventures, so we all have a vested interest in fostering an environment 
that helps them succeed, grow, and hire more workers. The creation of an
 innovation economy that’s driven by the rapid expansion of start-ups 
has never been more imperative.</p>
<p>In the past, growth in the number of start-ups was constrained by five factors in addition to the failure rate: 
 </p>

 
 <div>
  <p>The founders of lean start-ups don’t begin with a business plan; 
they begin with the search for a business model. Only after quick rounds
 of experimentation and feedback reveal a model that works do lean 
founders focus on execution.</p> 
  <div> 
   <p><img src="Why%20the%20Lean%20Start-Up%20Changes%20Everything_bestanden/R1305C_C_LG.gif" alt=""></p> 
  </div> 
 </div>

<p>1. The high cost of getting the first customer and the even higher cost of getting the product wrong.</p>
<p>2. Long technology development cycles.</p>
<p>3. The limited number of people with an appetite for the risks inherent in founding or working at a start-up.</p>
<p>4. The structure of the venture capital industry, in which a small 
number of firms each needed to invest big sums in a handful of start-ups
 to have a chance at significant returns.</p>
<p>5. The concentration of real expertise in how to build start-ups, 
which in the United States was mostly found in pockets on the East and 
West coasts. (This is less an issue in Europe and other parts of the 
world, but even overseas there are geographic entrepreneurial hot 
spots.)</p>
<p>The lean approach reduces the first two constraints by helping new 
ventures launch products that customers actually want, far more quickly 
and cheaply than traditional methods, and the third by making start-ups 
less risky. And it has emerged at a time when other business and 
technology trends are likewise breaking down the barriers to start-up 
formation. The combination of all these forces is altering the 
entrepreneurial landscape.</p>
<p>Today open source software, like GitHub, and cloud services, such as 
Amazon Web Services, have slashed the cost of software development from 
millions of dollars to thousands. Hardware start-ups no longer have to 
build their own factories, since offshore manufacturers are so easily 
accessible. Indeed, it’s become quite common to see young tech companies
 that practice the lean start-up methodology offer software products 
that are simply “bits” delivered over the web or hardware that’s built 
in China within weeks of being formed. Consider Roominate, a start-up 
designed to inspire girls’ confidence and interest in science, 
technology, engineering, and math. Once its founders had finished 
testing and iterating on the design of their wired dollhouse kit, they 
sent the specs off to a contract manufacturer in China. Three weeks 
later the first products arrived.</p>
<div>
 <p>Lean start-up practices aren’t just for young tech ventures. Large 
companies, such as GE and Intuit, have begun to implement them.</p>
</div>
<p>Another important trend is the decentralization of access to 
financing. Venture capital used to be a tight club of formal firms 
clustered near Silicon Valley, Boston, and New York. In today’s 
entrepreneurial ecosystem, new super angel funds, smaller than the 
traditional hundred-million-dollar-sized VC fund, can make early-stage 
investments. Worldwide, hundreds of accelerators, like Y Combinator and 
TechStars, have begun to formalize seed investments. And crowdsourcing 
sites like Kickstarter provide another, more democratic method of 
financing start-ups. 
 </p>
<p>The instantaneous availability of information is also a boon to 
today’s new ventures. Before the internet, new company founders got 
advice only as often as they could have coffee with experienced 
investors or entrepreneurs. Today the biggest challenge is sorting 
through the overwhelming amount of start-up advice they get. The lean 
concepts provide a framework that helps you differentiate the good from 
the bad.</p>

<p>Lean start-up techniques were initially designed to create 
fast-growing tech ventures. But I believe the concepts are equally valid
 for creating the Main Street small businesses that make up the bulk of 
the economy. If the entire universe of small business embraced them, I 
strongly suspect it would increase growth and efficiency, and have a 
direct and immediate impact on GDP and employment.</p>

<p>There are signs that this may in fact happen. In 2011 the U.S. 
National Science Foundation began using lean methods to commercialize 
basic science research in a program called the Innovation Corps. Eleven 
universities now teach the methods to hundreds of teams of senior 
research scientists across the United States.</p>
<p>MBA programs are adopting these techniques, too. For years they 
taught students to apply large-company approaches—such as accounting 
methods for tracking revenue and cash flow, and organizational theories 
about managing—to start-ups. Yet start-ups face completely different 
issues. Now business schools are realizing that new ventures need their 
own management tools.</p>
<p>As business schools embrace the distinction between management 
execution and searching for a business model, they’re abandoning the 
business plan as the template for entrepreneurial education. And the 
business plan competitions that have been a celebrated part of the MBA 
experience for over a decade are being replaced by business model 
competitions. (Harvard Business School became the latest to make this 
switch, in 2012.) Stanford, Harvard, Berkeley, and Columbia are leading 
the charge and embracing the lean start-up curriculum. My Lean LaunchPad
 course for educators is now training over 250 college and university 
instructors a year.</p>
<h2>A New Strategy for the 21st-Century Corporation</h2>
<p>It’s already becoming clear that lean start-up practices are not just for young tech ventures.</p>
<p>Corporations have spent the past 20 years increasing their efficiency
 by driving down costs. But simply focusing on improving existing 
business models is not enough anymore. Almost every large company 
understands that it also needs to deal with ever-increasing external 
threats by continually innovating. To ensure their survival and growth, 
corporations need to keep inventing new business models. This challenge 
requires entirely new organizational structures and skills.</p>
<p>Over the years managerial experts such as Clayton Christensen, Rita 
McGrath, Vijay Govindarajan, Henry Chesbrough, Ian MacMillan, Alexander 
Osterwalder, and Eric von Hippel have advanced the thinking on how large
 companies can improve their innovation processes. During the past three
 years, however, we have seen large companies, including General 
Electric, Qualcomm, and Intuit, begin to implement the lean start-up 
methodology. 
 </p>
<p>GE’s Energy Storage division, for instance, is using the approach to 
transform the way it innovates. In 2010 Prescott Logan, the general 
manager of the division, recognized that a new battery developed by the 
unit had the potential to disrupt the industry. Instead of preparing to 
build a factory, scale up production, and launch the new offering 
(ultimately named Durathon) as a traditional product extension, Logan 
applied lean techniques. He started searching for a business model and 
engaging in customer discovery. He and his team met face-to-face with 
dozens of global prospects to explore potential new markets and 
applications. These weren’t sales calls: The team members left their 
PowerPoint slides behind and listened to customers’ issues and 
frustrations with the battery status quo. They dug deep to learn how 
customers bought industrial batteries, how often they used them, and the
 operating conditions. With this feedback, they made a major shift in 
their customer focus. They eliminated one of their initial target 
segments, data centers, and discovered a new one—utilities. In addition,
 they narrowed the broad customer segment of “telecom” to cell phone 
providers in developing countries with unreliable electric grids. 
Eventually GE invested $100 million to build a world-class battery 
manufacturing facility in Schenectady, New York, which it opened in 
2012. According to press reports, demand for the new batteries is so 
high that GE is already running a backlog of orders.<span>The first 
hundred years of management education focused on building strategies and
 tools that formalized execution and efficiency for existing businesses.
 Now, we have the first set of tools for searching for new business 
models as we launch start-up ventures. It also happens to have arrived 
just in time to help existing companies deal with the forces of 
continual disruption. In the 21st century those forces will make people 
in every kind of organization—start-ups, small businesses, corporations,
 and government—feel the pressure of rapid change. The lean start-up 
approach will help them meet it head-on, innovate rapidly, and transform
 business as we know it.</span></p>
